***Childe Hassam***\
My first encounter with his works was at the [Museum of Fine Arts](https://customprints.mfa.org/detail/372190/hassam-at-dusk-boston-common-at-twilight-1885-86) in Boston.

***Frits Thaulow***\
Harvard Art Museums have [one](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/person/18590) of his paintings.

***Claude Monet***\
This person needs no introduction. My favorite is [La Japonaise](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/33556/la-japonaise-camille-monet-in-japanese-costume) at MFA, Boston.
