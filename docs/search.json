    "text": "I am an undergraduate student studying physics and mathematics at Harvard University, where I am part of Professor Norman Yao’s group.\nI am interested in exploring the intersection between theory and experiments on quantum many-body systems in AMO and condensed-matter physics.\nMy recent works include\n\nmany-body dynamics in NV centers\nquantum simulation with ultracold atoms\nlaser cooling and trapping of molecules in Professor John Doyle’s group.\n\n\nMy undergraduate and graduate studies are supported by Ezoe Memorial Recruit Foundation.\nFun fact: my name is officially spelled as ‘Tasuku’ in the alphabet under the Hepburn Romanization system. However, the two ‘u’s are barely pronounced in Japanese (called vowel devoicing; see this concise article on the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies website). So the actual pronunciation sounds closer to ’Task’ as in the English word ‘task’."
